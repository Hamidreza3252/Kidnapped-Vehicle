    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "This repository contains the codes for the Localization course, *kidnapped vehicle*. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## 2. Project Introduction\n",
    "The aim of this project is to localize the vehicle or robot using the provided map of the location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of the initial location of the vehicle, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data. To do so, a 2-dimensional particle filter was developed in C++. The particle filter algorithm will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step of the simulation, the filter will also get observation and control data. The localization error is measured against the ground-truth values in the simulation. \n",
    " \n",
    "The passing criteria for the success of the project are: \n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: The particle filter should localize vehicle position and yaw to within the values specified in the parameters `max_translation_error` and `max_yaw_error` in `src/main.cpp`. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**: The particle filter should complete execution within the time of 100 seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Running the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. mkdir build\n",
    "2. cd build\n",
    "3. cmake ..\n",

    "1. ./clean.sh\n",
    "2. ./build.sh\n",
    "3. ./run.sh\n",
